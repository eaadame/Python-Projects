## About
In this project, I built out a movie recommender system using a correlation matrix that matched user feedback to movies they had watched. 

## Data
I referenced the steps found at Analytics India Magazine. (https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-to-build-your-first-recommender-system-using-python-movielens-dataset/)

However, for this project, I ensured that the recommender system relied on specific user input in order for the system to work. This was done by including a simple UserInput option.

## Conclusion
In this project, I did not use a specific package that would help with building a recommender system. I found it very valuable to be able to build this type of system with simple packages that are generally known by all python coders. From this system, I was able to find 10 movies that would be recommended to a user selected movie. I found that it was better to have more reviews with lower correlation. When I had the Total Ratings set to over 50, rather than 100, I was getting movies that I, as a person who has seen Star Trek (2009) would not reccommend to another person. When upping the Total Ratings to over 100, I recieved movies that I would recommend to another person if they liked Star Trek (2009).
