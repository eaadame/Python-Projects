## About

In the last few years, various forms of malicious software, or malware, have been released on the public domain to wreak havoc and harvest credentials that can be used to pilfer money or steal sensitive information. The most notable attack was the Solarwinds hack beginning in December 2020, which compromised the supply chain of the software developed by Solarwinds. One customer of Solarwinds software, Microsoft, was able to confirm that attackers were able to take advantage of Microsoft program configuration weaknesses to probe deeper into the network. There is no surprise that malware would be used to move deeper into the target space. PCMag reported that of all malware attacks that occurred in the first few months of 2020, Microsoft Windows computers were the primary targets, being hit 83% of the time. (Cohen, 2020).

While Microsoft Defender works to catch all types of emerging threats, it works to catch threats that have only made it into the network. What Microsoft Defender does not do is provide an assessment of the vulnerability of the system based on inherent factors or traits. This research group has identified a dataset to identify the likelihood of machine or system being targeted or compromised by malware based on the various traits or properties of the associated machine or system. The output of this research could be incorporated into the already existing infrastructure of Microsoft Windows Defender to provide a more holistic understanding of the network and to work to proactively secure identified vulnerable systems.


## Data
The data for this project was collected by Microsoft in 2019 from 8.9 million various Microsoft systems. The dataset contains specific machine information such as the version and build of the current Operating System (OS) as well as other Device Census data. These attributes are critical to developing a model that can predict malware presence as these are the attributes targeted for exploitation from malicious attackers. Microsoft has also provided the ‘HasDetections’ variable.

## Conclusion
As we were limited by computing power and the time it took for each of the models to run, we had no choice but to leave the models with a Recall score of 0.59. While this is not ideal, it is 0.11 points away from our target Recall score of 0.70. We feel that increasing the total number of features included in the model would increase the Recall score. However, we cannot do this model creation with our current equipment and resources. The original error we saw when attempting to build our model weeks ago with all features showed that 74 TB of memory would be needed. We feel that a company would need to invest in cloud computing to be able to perform the calculations required for the model. Additionally, we acknowledge that Microsoft collected this data from it’s endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender. Windows Defender automatically prepares reports with system information and sends the report back to Microsoft. To turn this feature off, a user must manually disable the automatic reports sent to Microsoft. As such, we are aware that the data came from an unstandardized set of users. We believe that this model would produce better outputs if it were to be applied to a standardized dataset from a single company’s systems. Companies can control their system settings by enforcing what OS is running, what version of that OS is allowed, and other variables related to the system. A more focused dataset would allow us to better understand the companies needs and tailor a model to their data.
