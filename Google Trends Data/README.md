## About

In this project, I examined the effects the Great Recession of 2007 had on insomnia rates in the United States. 

## The Data

The data used for this project was collected using Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/home) and using the following search terms:

* insomnia
* Sonata or sonata
* Lunesta or lunesta
* Ambien or ambien

The data was focused specifically on the region of the United States and then further narrowed down by state. 

## Conclusion

As it stands, a reasonable assumption could be made that the Great Recession played a large, if not singular, role in creating an environment of anxiety and unsurety throughout the country, especially in the Southern region. This time of uncertainty led many to lose sleep and turn to sleep aids as a result. What is not known, nor can be reasonably explained, is why insomnia trends continued to rise long after the period by which the United States was said to have recovered. Further study is need to determine that answer.
