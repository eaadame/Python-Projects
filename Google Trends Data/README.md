## About

In this project, I examined the effects the Great Recession of 2007 had on insomnia rates in the United States through Google Trends data. I executed this project primarily through Microsoft Excel and through thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I first began this project by noting at what point Google Trends showed that searches for 'insomnia' were rising. I was able to show using Google Trends that prior to the Great Recession, insomnia rates seemed to be trending downward and appeared on the rise after the start of the Great Recession.

## The Data

The data used for this project was collected using Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/home) and using the following search terms:

* insomnia
* Sonata or sonata
* Lunesta or lunesta
* Ambien or ambien

The data was focused specifically on the region of the United States and then further narrowed down by state. 

## Conclusion

As it stands, a reasonable assumption could be made that the Great Recession played a large, if not singular, role in creating an environment of anxiety and unsurety throughout the country, especially in the Southern region. This time of uncertainty led many to lose sleep and turn to sleep aids as a result. What is not known, nor can be reasonably explained, is why insomnia trends continued to rise long after the period by which the United States was said to have recovered. Further investigation must also be conducted to determine why the Eastern and Southeastern regions of the United States appeared to be more heavily impacted than other regions.
