## About

In this project, I practiced using Principle Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset provided. 

## The Data

Data take from academic source.

## Conclusion

From the PCA component selection, I can see that choosing K=2 was most likely the best option. From step 5, I broke the data into 2 clusters and fit a model using K-Means. After fitting a PCA transformation to the scaled data, I used the created array, model1, as my labels for plotting. I assigned the 'Segment K-Means PCA' to the labels from model1 and based on Figure 1, the labels and the feature selection from the PCA transformation fit near perfectly.
