## About

For this project, I sought to determine whether the opening moves made in a chess game affected the outcome of the game. I discovered through my analysis that there is a statistically significant relationship between these two variables. This significance does not necessarily mean that one opening move over the other guarantees a win or a loss, but it does show that it can impact the game. 

For this project, I chose to perform analysis of the top five most used chess openings. These were the Sicilian Defense, French Defense, Queen’s Pawn Game, Italian Game, and King’s Pawn Game. I found through my scatterplot and pmf, that these openings did not have a high correlation to games ending in a draw, or games that ended due to running out of time. Three openings, Sicilian Defense, French Defense, and Queen’s Pawn Game, related to a large number of games ending in a player resigning.
