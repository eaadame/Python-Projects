## About
In this project, I used the MNIST dataset to build out a neural network that classify images.

## Data
MNIST Dataset

## Conclusion
The accuracy of the neural network model came to be 98% accurate. The confusion matrix showed that the worst predictions were for values thought to be the value 8. The model predicted wrong for value 8 the highest amount of times. Value 5 had the least amount of wrong predictions while value 2 came in close second.
