## About

This is a repository of projects that demonstrate my work in data science to date. 

## Project List

1. [Dimensionality Reduction with KNN Analysis](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Dimensionality%20Reduction%20with%20KNN%20Analysis)

In this project, I examine a dataset consisting of ALS patien information. I use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the large dataset in order to build out a better visualization of the K-Nearest Neighbor Model.

2. [Google Trends Data](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Google%20Trends%20Data)

In this project, I examined the effects of the Great Recession of 2007 had on insomnia rates in the United States through Google Trends Data.

3. [Machine Learning Model for Zelda BOTW Weaponry](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Model%20for%20Zelda%20BOTW%20Weaponry)

This project aimed to produce a model that would predict which weapon within *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* should be used against specific beasts based on limited inventory space. 

4. [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System)

This project produced a movie recommender system based on how closely the movies relate based on ratings provided by others who have seen the movie. 

5. [Neural Network](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Neural%20Network)

A neural network for predicting number values based on images shown to it. 

6. [Predictive Modeling - Caregiver Health](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20-%20Caregiver%20Health)

This project addressed the health issues of home caregivers in the United States. A KNN model was built and used to determine the overall health of a home caregiver based on several factors, to include length of care provided, the longevity of the care, and whether support services were found lacking.

7. [Predictive Modeling of Systems Vulnerable to Malware](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20of%20Systems%20Vulnerable%20to%20Malware)

This project created a model that would identify whether a system would be infected with malware based on several system attributes. 

8. [Regression Analysis of Opening Chess Moves](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Regression%20Analysis%20of%20Opening%20Chess%20Moves)

A regression analysis of the top 5 opening chess moves was conducted to determine if opening moves had any bearing on the overall outcome of the game. A statistically significant relationship between opening moves and game outcome was noted.

9. [Sports Analytics - Null Hypothesis Testing and Logistic Regression](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Sports%20Analytics%20-%20Null%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20and%20Logistic%20Regression)

In this project, I used Null Hypothesis Testing and Logistic Regression to determine the aspects that make a team successful in the NCAA Men's Division 1 Basketball Tournament.
