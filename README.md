## About

This is a repository of projects that demonstrate my work in data science to date. 

## Project List

1. [Dimensionality Reduction with KNN Analysis](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Dimensionality%20Reduction%20with%20KNN%20Analysis)

In this project, I examine a dataset consisting of ALS patien information. I use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the large dataset in order to build out a better visualization of the K-Nearest Neighbor Model.

2. [Google Trends Data](https://github.com/eaadame/Python-Projects/tree/main/Google%20Trends%20Data)

In this project, I examined the effects of the Great Recession of 2007 had on insomnia rates in the United States through Google Trends Data.
